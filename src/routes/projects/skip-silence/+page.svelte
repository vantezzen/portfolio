	<Section title="About">
		<p>
			During the pandemic, I had to watch hours of video lectures that my professors recorded. While
			some of these lectures can have a very good pace, a lot of these videos are also very slow and
			the lecturers can take very long to write something down.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-2">
			This extension{' '}
			<span class="text-orange-500 font-bold">analyzes audio</span> playing in the browser to automatically
			speed up the video when the lecturer is silent.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-2">
			The extension has been rewritten for{' '}
			<span class="text-orange-500 font-bold"> the Plasmo extension framework </span>{' '}
			to allow for easier development and maintenance. It has been installed over 10.000 times across
			Chrome and Firefox.

	<Section title="Lessons learned">
		<p>
			Due this extension, I learned about the JavaScript Media APIs and what it possible with the
			Media Nodes available.<br />
			The extension seems to use the Media APIs in a way that is not intended by the browser develops.
			Due to this, I often encountered bugs in the browser's implementations and had to work around them.
