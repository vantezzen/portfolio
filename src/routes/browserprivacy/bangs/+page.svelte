		<h2 id="asmallletterfromthecreators">A small letter from the creators of the extension</h2>

		<p>
			"Bangs for Google" was created to help you use Google - not limit your privacy. This is why we
			dispense with using analytics in our extension and do not sell your personal data to anyone.
		</p>

		<p>
			We never store any of your search queries or other browsing data but simply redirect your to
			DuckDuckGo whenever your query start with a "!".
		</p>

		<h2 id="introducingtheprivacypolicy">Introducing the Privacy Policy</h2>

		<p>
			This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how "Bangs for Google" ("extension", "browser
			extension" or "we") collects and uses information from users of the browser extension.
		</p>

		<p>
			This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which we will process information we collect from
			you, or that you provide to us, in connection with your use of the extension, regardless of
			how you access or use them. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand
			your rights in relation to how we use and process information that you share and that we
			collect.
		</p>

		<p>
			The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope,
			purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own
			control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party
			components we use to provide our service which will result in said third parties also
			processing data they collect and control.

		<h2 id="informationourbrowserextensioncollects">Information our browser extension collects</h2>

		<p>
			Our browser extension uses your search query whenever you visit Google. This data will not be
			sent to any of our servers. Instead, we locally check, if the query starts with a "!" and
			redirect you to DuckDuckGo if that is the case.
		</p>

		<p>
			Your data processed when using our extension will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose
			for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any
			statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
		</p>

		<h2 id="informationwedonotcollect">Information we do not collect</h2>

		<p>
			We only collect the query locally. This means we do not collect any data on e.g. your search
			history, your emails, your credit card information or other information about your browser.
		</p>

		<h2 id="howwestoreyourinformation">How we store your information</h2>

		<p>We do not store the information our browser extension collects in any way ourselves.</p>

		<p>
			We created the extension for the exclusive use of adults aged 18 and older. We do not
			knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under the age
			of 18; if you are a child under 18, please do not attempt to use this extension or send any
			personal information about yourself to us. As we do not collect any information about our
			users, you will not need to contact us about the removal of any of your data.
		</p>

		<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

			We will continue to update our policies and practices as needed. As such, our Privacy Policy
			will be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by
