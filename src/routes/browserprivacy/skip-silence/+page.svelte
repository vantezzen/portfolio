			Additionally, our browser extension saves the settings you set using{' '}
			<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/storage"> Chrome's extension storage system </a>
			. Your settings will be Synchronised across all your devices using Chrome's built-in setting synchronisation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Your data processed when using our extension will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose
			for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any
			statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
