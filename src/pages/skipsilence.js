              During this pandemic, I have to watch hours of video lectures that my professors recorded.
              While some of these lectures can have a very good pace, a lot of these videos are also very slow and the lecturers can take very long to write something down.
            </ProjectParagraph>
            <ProjectParagraph>
              Due to these hours of watching slow lectures, I remembered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ8orIurGxw">YouTube video from CaryKH</a>, in which he created a software to speed up silent parts of lectures using a python script.

            <ProjectParagraph>
              While this script worked great, I didn't want to need to download all lectures before I can run them through the script - getting rid of any of the saved time.

              This is why I started to develop a WebExtension that does the same thing

              How does it work?
            </ProjectHeading>
            "Skip Silence" attaches a Media Volume listener to the current <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element.<br />
            It then uses this information to dynamically speed up or slow down the media, based on the settings set in the popup.

          <h2>What I've learned</h2>
          <p>
            Due this extension, I learned about the JavaScript Media APIs and what it possible with the Media Nodes available.<br />
            This is also my first project, in which I used the benefits of TypeScript. I already used it before on smaller parts of other project, but this is the first project that uses TypeScript thoughout its components.
